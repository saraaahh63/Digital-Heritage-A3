        <h2>About</h2>
        <p id="ptext">
                Built in 1509 during the Ming Dynasty, Humble Administrator’s Garden（拙政园）is one of the largest and most well renowned classical gardens in Southern China. The garden takes its name from a book of prose by famous poet Pan Yue entitled An Idle Life. Humble Administrator’s Garden was originally built as a private garden for Wang Xianchen, a former government official. Wang had been unhappy with his career and intended to retire and spend his time cultivating land instead. He valued a simple and humble life, hence his inspiration for the garden’s name.<br><br>The garden is so beautifully and meticulously designed that it has served as the inspiration for many artistic works, including the garden in Dream of the Red Chamber by Cao Xueqin. Due to its design, history and cultural significance, Humble Administrator’s Garden was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.<br><br>The garden contains numerous pavilions and bridges set among a maze of connected pools and islands. It can be categorized into three major parts set about a large lake: the central part, the eastern part, and the western part.

        <h2>The Eastern Garden</h2>
        <p id="ptext">
            The East Garden is large and spacious. Having only a few buildings, the main attraction is the central great lawn surrounded by a large pond. The lawn is ringed by crape myrtle trees which is a reference to the Tang Dynasty State Secretariat who was nicknamed the Crape Myrtle Department. Main buildings in this garden include the Celestial Spring Pavilion and Lotus Pavilion among others.

        <h2>The Western Garden</h2>
        <p id="ptext">
            The Western Garden is the smallest of the three yet does not feel cluttered and the small mountains and ponds do not make it feel cramped. Mostly dominated by water, the pond runs from north to south having a small island in the center. Although not large, it is planned with meticulous care and precision showcasing the time and energy used for every single detail in the garden. Main buildings include the Reflection Hall, 36 Mandarin Ducks Pavillion, and the Floating Green Tower.
